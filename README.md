<!-- Welcome to our Virtual Pet! This program allows the user to create a pet that they can take care of by accessing specific methods that keep their pet alive. If the user does not access the correct method, the pet will eventually become unhappy and die. Throughout the program, if the user enters “0”, the program will exit and thank the user for playing with the Virtual Pet. In this program, there will be four classes, Cat, Dog, Fish, and Rabbit. The classes are the different pets available within the program. Each class will have methods that are specific to that class along with attributes that are specific to the pet, depending on the pet that is chosen. Attributes of the specific pet will be stored in arrays that are accessed throughout each run of the program. These attributes (color, breed, age, etc.) of the pet are chosen randomly each time the program is run. The program then informs the user what color/breed/age of pet they have. Methods will be called either by the user choosing the method or randomly by the program itself using a random number generator to choose the method. This will ensure that the program will always be different each time the user runs it.  If the user inputs an invalid statement, the program will throw an exception to indicate that the input was invalid. When the pet dies, the user will be prompted to choose another virtual pet or to exit the program.  -->
